# Arduino with unit tests

This example program defines classes for the Arduino Spaceship Interface Example and uses unit tests to test the higher level classes that do not have any arduino implementation. The Makefile defines the compilation of the tests and the arduino code, as well as the upload to the arduino board - without any need for the Arduino IDE.
